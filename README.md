### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Image Reduction
Dark frame correction is not implemented. This is because the CCD used on the 1.9m telescope is cryogenically cooled to temperatures around 170 K, rendering the dark current negligible.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration: `defaults.json`
This pipeline uses a JSON configuration file to control all steps of spectral reduction and calibration. Below is a description of the parameters and their purpose.

### 1. Trim Bounds (`trim_bounds`)
Defines the region of the CCD image to keep after trimming the raw frame.

- `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, `y_max`: pixel boundaries to crop the image.  
  Removes overscan regions and unused parts of the detector.


### 2. Display Plots (`display_plots`)
Boolean flag to toggle plotting of intermediate steps.  
Useful for debugging and visual verification.


### 3. Cosmic Ray Rejection (`cosmic_ray`)
Controls the removal of cosmic ray hits from science and calibration frames using a sigma-clipping algorithm.

- `sigclip`: sigma threshold above which pixels are flagged as cosmic rays.  
- `sigfrac`: fractional detection threshold used in identifying cosmic rays.  
- `objlim`: minimum contrast between object and cosmic ray to distinguish them.


### 4. Atlas Lines (`atlas_lines`)
Reference arc-lamp wavelengths used for wavelength calibration.

- Keys correspond to grating identifiers (`"7"`, `"6"`, `"13"`, `"custom"`).  
- Values are lists of known emission line wavelengths in √Öngstr√∂m for each grating.  
- `"custom"` can be used for user-supplied line lists.


### 5. Standard Star Name (`standard_name`)
Name of the spectrophotometric standard star used for flux calibration (e.g., `ltt6248`).


### 6. Tracing Parameters (`trace_kwargs`)
Controls how the spectrum is traced along the dispersion axis.  
Separate settings exist for **science** and **standard** frames.

- `nspec`: number of spectra to trace in the frame.  
- `nwindow`: half-window size (in pixels) used when locating the spectrum.  
- `trace_width`: width of the spectral trace in pixels.  
- `resample_factor`: factor by which the trace is oversampled before fitting.  
- `fit_deg`: degree of the polynomial used to fit the trace.  
- `display`: whether to show the trace fitting plot.  
- `width`, `height`: dimensions of the input image (used for normalization).


### 7. Extraction Parameters (`extract_kwargs`)
Controls how the 1D spectrum is extracted from the 2D frame.  
Separate settings exist for **science** and **standard** frames.

- `apwidth`: half-width of the extraction aperture (in pixels).  
- `optimal`: whether to use optimal extraction (weights by signal-to-noise).  
- `algorithm`: extraction algorithm, e.g., `"horne86"` (Horne 1986 optimal extraction).  
- `skysep`: minimum distance (in pixels) between spectrum and sky regions.  
- `skywidth`: width of sky background region (in pixels).  
- `skydeg`: polynomial degree for fitting the sky background.  
- `display`: whether to show the extraction step.


### 8. Hough Transform Parameters (`hough`)
Controls automated line identification using a Hough transform.

- `num_slopes`: number of slope values sampled in the transform.  
- `xbins`, `ybins`: binning for the transform parameter space.  
- `min_wavelength`, `max_wavelength`: expected wavelength range (√Ö).  
- `range_tolerance`: tolerance (√Ö) when matching atlas lines.


### 9. Wavelength Calibration (`wavelength_cal`)
Controls how arc lamp lines are matched and fitted to derive the wavelength solution.  
Separate settings exist for **science** and **standard** frames.

- `prominence`: required prominence of peaks for line detection.  
- `refine`: whether to iteratively refine the wavelength solution.  
- `ransac_minimum_matches`: minimum number of line matches required for RANSAC fitting.  
- `fit_max_tries`: maximum number of fitting attempts before failing.  
- `fit_deg`: polynomial degree of the wavelength solution.  
- `fit_type`: type of fit (e.g., `"poly"` for polynomial).

## üì§ Output
Several output files are created, but there are three main output files that are important:

- `object_name_final.csv` - final fully reduced csv file containing wavelength (√Ö), flux, flux error, sky flux
- `object_name_snid.csv` - SNID ready formatted csv file (space-seperated) for quick transient identification
- `object_name_log_file.txt` - log file containing all terminal output from ASPIRED. If run in verbose mode, you will get all of the useful statistics ASPIRED produces saved in this file.

## üß™ Developer Notes
This pipeline is built on the excellent ASPIRED library by Marco Lam. terminally_ASPIRED wraps its lower-level functionality to streamline workflows, reduce bugs, and standardize output for further scientific use.
