```bash
pip install --upgrade setuptools jmespath -i https://pypi.org/simple && \
pip install terminally-aspired
```

#### Step 4: Verify the Installation

To make sure that the package installed correctly, run the --help argument. It sometimes takes a few minutes to run on a fresh install.
```bash
tA --help
```


#### Step 5: Copy `defaults.json` as template and save in working directory 

The main way you will interact with terminally_ASPIRED is thorugh the config `.json` file, so you should copy the `defaults.json` file to use as a template and rename it to whatever is convienient. 
You can use a built-in function in terminally_ASPIRED to do this: 
```bash
make-config -n name_of_config_file -O directory_to_store_config
```
This will create a copy of the defaults.json file and rename it to what you choose (remeber to include the .json extention) as well as save it to a output directory of your choice. Then when calling terminally_ASPIRED, you can point to your own config file by making use of the `--config` argument.

## üöÄ CLI Usage
### Basic Usage 
```bash
tA science.fits arc.fits standard.fits standard_arc.fits -gr 7 -f flat_dir -b bias_dir --config path/to/config.json
```
This will call terminally_ASPIRED and reduce the science.fits file for data from grating 7. This will work well once you have gotten some settings in the config files just right for this particular set of data.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Image Reduction
Dark frame correction is not implemented. This is because the CCD used on the 1.9m telescope is cryogenically cooled to temperatures around 170 K, rendering the dark current negligible.

## ü™ÅExample - First time reduction with a new set of data

Often, when you have a fresh set of data you will need to carefully monitor how the pipeline deals with trace extraction & wavelength and flux calibration. Therefore for a first run with new data we reccomend to make use of the `--show-plots` argument which will show you the ASPIRED intermediate plots. 

### Step 1: Standard Star name in `config.json`

Remember to input your standard star name in lower case letters into your `config.json` file under the parameter `standard_name` (examples: hilt600, ltt6248 etc)

### Step 2: Run the pipeline with `--show-plots` enabled

```bash
tA science.fits arc.fits standard.fits standard_arc.fits -gr 7 -f flat_dir -b bias_dir --config path/to/config.json --show-plots
```

### Step 3: Wavelength Calibration 
A particular sticky point is typically wavelength calibration, due to the way in which the auto-detection of the peaks of the arc spectrum works. You can control the wavelength calibration in the `config.json` file, located under the header `hough` and  `wavelength_cal`. 

#### `hough`
Here you need to pay attention to `min_wavelength` and `max_wavelength`, as these will depend on the particular grating and grating angle you use. For:
- grating 6 : Use `min_wavelength` = 4500  , `max_wavelength` = 7000
- grating 7 : Use `min_wavelength` = 3500  , `max_wavelength` = 9000


#### `wavelength_cal`
Here you need to pay attention to the `prominence` parameter. This sets the level of relative flux above which the auto-peak detection will detect peaks in the arc spectrum. You must make sure that the `prominence` level is such that the peaks that are auto detected match up with the peaks within the wavelength atlas of the chosen grating. You can find the wavelength atlases for the different grating on the [SAAO SpUpNIC TOPS Wiki](https://topswiki.saao.ac.za/index.php/SPUPNIC). The pipeline by default contains atlases for gratings 6 and 7 (and soon 13), but you still need to make sure that they line up with the detected peaks correctly. You can also add your own lines to these atlases. Once this is done the pipeline should do the wavelength calibration quickly and well. 

### Step 4: Inspect output
Make sure that the spectrum that is returned looks reasonable. You can plot the error and sky flux by making use of the `--show-error` and `--show-sky` arguments for further confirmation. Alternatively you can use the interactive html plots produced by ASPIRED from the `--show-plots` argument.

### Step 5: Reduce the rest of the data.
Once you are happy with a particular spectrum from a night, you can process the rest of them by making use of a simple call to terminally_ASPIRED: 
```bash
tA science.fits science_arc.fits standard.fits standard_arc.fits -gr 7 --config config.json -f flat_dir -b bias_dir

```
This will simply process the images and plot the final spectrum for inspection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration: `config.json`
This pipeline uses a JSON configuration file to control all steps of spectral reduction and calibration. Below is a description of the parameters and their purpose.

### 1. Trim Bounds (`trim_bounds`)
Defines the region of the CCD image to keep after trimming the raw frame.

- `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, `y_max`: pixel boundaries to crop the image.  
  Removes overscan regions and unused parts of the detector.


### 2. Display Plots (`display_plots`)
Boolean flag to toggle plotting of intermediate steps.  
Useful for debugging and visual verification.


### 3. Cosmic Ray Rejection (`cosmic_ray`)
Controls the removal of cosmic ray hits from science and calibration frames using a sigma-clipping algorithm.

- `sigclip`: sigma threshold above which pixels are flagged as cosmic rays.  
- `sigfrac`: fractional detection threshold used in identifying cosmic rays.  
- `objlim`: minimum contrast between object and cosmic ray to distinguish them.


### 4. Atlas Lines (`atlas_lines`)
Reference arc-lamp wavelengths used for wavelength calibration.

- Keys correspond to grating identifiers (`"7"`, `"6"`, `"13"`, `"custom"`).  
- Values are lists of known emission line wavelengths in √Öngstr√∂m for each grating.  
- `"custom"` can be used for user-supplied line lists.


### 5. Standard Star Name (`standard_name`)
Name of the spectrophotometric standard star used for flux calibration (e.g., `ltt6248`).


### 6. Tracing Parameters (`trace_kwargs`)
Controls how the spectrum is traced along the dispersion axis.  
Separate settings exist for **science** and **standard** frames.

- `nspec`: number of spectra to trace in the frame.  
- `nwindow`: half-window size (in pixels) used when locating the spectrum.  
- `trace_width`: width of the spectral trace in pixels.  
- `resample_factor`: factor by which the trace is oversampled before fitting.  
- `fit_deg`: degree of the polynomial used to fit the trace.  
- `display`: whether to show the trace fitting plot.  
- `width`, `height`: dimensions of the input image (used for normalization).


### 7. Extraction Parameters (`extract_kwargs`)
Controls how the 1D spectrum is extracted from the 2D frame.  
Separate settings exist for **science** and **standard** frames.

- `apwidth`: half-width of the extraction aperture (in pixels).  
- `optimal`: whether to use optimal extraction (weights by signal-to-noise).  
- `algorithm`: extraction algorithm, e.g., `"horne86"` (Horne 1986 optimal extraction).  
- `skysep`: minimum distance (in pixels) between spectrum and sky regions.  
- `skywidth`: width of sky background region (in pixels).  
- `skydeg`: polynomial degree for fitting the sky background.  
- `display`: whether to show the extraction step.


### 8. Hough Transform Parameters (`hough`)
Controls automated line identification using a Hough transform.

- `num_slopes`: number of slope values sampled in the transform.  
- `xbins`, `ybins`: binning for the transform parameter space.  
- `min_wavelength`, `max_wavelength`: expected wavelength range (√Ö).  
- `range_tolerance`: tolerance (√Ö) when matching atlas lines.


### 9. Wavelength Calibration (`wavelength_cal`)
Controls how arc lamp lines are matched and fitted to derive the wavelength solution.  
Separate settings exist for **science** and **standard** frames.

- `prominence`: required prominence of peaks for line detection.  
- `refine`: whether to iteratively refine the wavelength solution.  
- `ransac_minimum_matches`: minimum number of line matches required for RANSAC fitting.  
- `fit_max_tries`: maximum number of fitting attempts before failing.  
- `fit_deg`: polynomial degree of the wavelength solution.  
- `fit_type`: type of fit (e.g., `"poly"` for polynomial).

## üì§ Output
Several output files are created, but there are three main output files that are important:

- `object_name_final.csv` - final fully reduced csv file containing wavelength (√Ö), flux, flux error, sky flux
- `object_name_snid.csv` - SNID ready formatted csv file (space-separated) for quick transient identification
- `object_name_log_file.txt` - log file containing all terminal output from ASPIRED. If run in verbose mode, you will get all of the useful statistics ASPIRED produces saved in this file.
